Become An Ethereum Blockchain Developer, by Packt Publishing

Embark on a transformative journey into blockchain technology with the Ethereum Blockchain Developer Bootcamp with Solidity. Learn with the latest blockchain development tools and gain hands-on experience by building real-world projects. 

Ethereum blockchain development involves creating decentralized applications (DApps), smart contracts, and other digital assets on the Ethereum blockchain platform. Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain network known for supporting smart contracts, self-executing agreements with predefined rules that automatically execute. Ethereum development involves writing code in the Solidity programming language. 

The course begins with an introduction to the course and progresses to the Remix IDE, covering topics such as Blockchain basics and reading/writing smart contracts. It progresses into hands-on projects, the Blockchain Messenger, to explore Booleans, integers, and address types. The course progresses to Smart Money - Deposit and Withdrawals, diving into Metamask, Ethereum transactions, and the payable modifier. Smart Wallet takes us into Solidity mappings, structs, and low-level Solidity calls. Moving forward into ERC20 Token Sale projects, Web3.js, event handling, and modifiers lead to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) involving Truffle, smart contract debugging, and deployment. The course wraps up by exploring alternative development frameworks such as Hardhat and Foundry. 

Upon completing the course, we will be proficient in Solidity programming, smart contract development, and blockchain usage. We will have hands-on experience building real projects, including decentralized applications (DApps) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and contribute to blockchain projects.
